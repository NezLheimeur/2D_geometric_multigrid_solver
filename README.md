# 2D_geometric_multigrid_solver
Implementation of a 2D  geometric multigrid V-cycle and W-cycle in python.

Two type of pre-smoother are implemented: a <b>successive over relaxation (SOR)</b> method and a <b>Jacobi over relaxation method (JOR)</b>

Also Two version of the mutigrid is implemented: one for the <b>V-cycle</b> and another one for the <b>W-cycle</b>.

the exemple given use an the null vector for the initialisation and a random vector for the right hand side.
